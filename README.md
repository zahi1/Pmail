# Pmail - An Emailing System for Job Applications

Pmail is a comprehensive email system designed specifically for job applications and employer-employee communication. It features spam detection using machine learning, job application tracking, and a user-friendly interface for employees, employers, and administrators.

The system supports three distinct user roles:
